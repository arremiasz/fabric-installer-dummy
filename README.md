# fabric-mod-installer-tool
An Installer for Fabric. For the vanilla launcher. 
Configurable mod setup tool to send to your friends who struggle with mod installs.

# Features

## Import Mods
You can import mods from a folder to be installed. These are saved in the `mods` folder in the same directory 
as the exe. To clear the imports, simply delete this folder or import new mods which will overwrite the old ones.

## Modrinth Support:
Paste links or the slug (https:\/\/modrinth.com/mod/`modmenu`) in their own lines to download and 
install mods from Modrinth. The installer will automatically grab the latest version of the mod matching the 
Minecraft version selected. If a specific version is desired, download the mod and import it using 
the tool instead.
